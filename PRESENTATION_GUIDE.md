```
üîÑ DATA PIPELINE

RAW DATA ‚Üí PREPROCESSING ‚Üí FEATURE ENGINEERING ‚Üí MODEL INPUT

PREPROCESSING STEPS:
1. Data Type Conversion
   ‚Ä¢ TotalCharges: string ‚Üí numeric
   ‚Ä¢ Handle missing values

2. Categorical Encoding
   ‚Ä¢ Binary: Male/Female ‚Üí 1/0
   ‚Ä¢ Multi-class: One-hot encoding for services

3. Feature Scaling
   ‚Ä¢ StandardScaler for numerical features
   ‚Ä¢ Ensures all features have similar ranges

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
‚Ä¢ tenure_MonthlyCharges: Interaction feature
‚Ä¢ TotalCharges_per_Month: Derived ratio feature

FINAL DATASET:

‚Ä¢ All numeric, ready for ML algorithms
```

#### Presenter Notes:
**Data Pipeline Importance (30 seconds):**
"Data preprocessing is often 70% of the ML workflow. Our pipeline automates this completely."

**Preprocessing Details (45 seconds):**
- "We convert categorical variables to numbers using one-hot encoding"
- "StandardScaler ensures features like 'age' and 'monthly charges' have similar importance"
- "We handle missing values and data type inconsistencies automatically"

**Feature Engineering (30 seconds):**
"We created interaction features - like tenure times monthly charges - which often improve model performance by capturing relationships between variables."

**Pipeline Benefits:**
"This preprocessing pipeline is reusable - it automatically handles new data with the same transformations."

**Code Example:**
"Let me show you a quick example..." [If doing live demo, show the preprocessing function]

**Transition:** "Once our data is ready, we move to model development and experiment tracking..."

```
üß™ MODEL DEVELOPMENT & TRACKING

ALGORITHMS TESTED:
1. Logistic Regression
   ‚Ä¢ Best performer: AUC = 0.508
   ‚Ä¢ Fast, interpretable baseline

2. Random Forest
   ‚Ä¢ AUC = 0.500
   ‚Ä¢ Good for feature importance

3. Gradient Boosting
   ‚Ä¢ AUC = 0.498
   ‚Ä¢ Complex model, prone to overfitting

MLFLOW EXPERIMENT TRACKING:
‚Ä¢ Automatic logging of parameters
‚Ä¢ Metric tracking (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC)
‚Ä¢ Model artifact storage
‚Ä¢ Confusion matrix visualization
‚Ä¢ Model comparison and selection

BEST MODEL SELECTION:
‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression chosen (highest AUC)
‚Ä¢ Serialized to pickle format
‚Ä¢ Feature names and scaler saved
‚Ä¢ Ready for production deployment
```

#### Presenter Notes:

**MLflow Benefits (45 seconds):**
"MLflow automatically tracks every experiment - parameters, metrics, and model artifacts. This is crucial for reproducibility and model governance."

**Experiment Tracking Demo:**
"Let me show you the MLflow UI..." [If live demo available, show experiments]
- "Each run shows different hyperparameters and results"
- "We can compare models side-by-side"
- "All models and preprocessing artifacts are stored"

**Model Selection Process:**
"We select the best model based on AUC-ROC score, but in production you'd consider multiple factors like inference speed, interpretability, and business constraints."

**Production Readiness:**
"Our model is serialized with its preprocessing pipeline, making it immediately deployable."

**Transition:** "Now let's see how we serve this model through a production API..."

## Slide 11: Challenges & Solutions

### **Technical Challenges Overcome**

#### Slide Content:
```
üöß CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

CHALLENGE 1: Docker Networking
Problem: Prometheus couldn't connect to FastAPI
Solution: Changed config from 'app:8000' to 'host.docker.internal:8000'
Impact: Monitoring dashboard now works perfectly

CHALLENGE 2: CI/CD Pipeline Failures  
Problem: Linting conflicts, import errors, authentication issues
Solution: Added pyproject.toml, fixed PYTHONPATH, updated actions
Impact: 100% reliable automated pipeline

CHALLENGE 3: Synthetic Data Limitations
Problem: Poor model performance (AUC ~0.51)
Solution: Focused on MLOps pipeline demonstration
Impact: Complete system despite model limitations

CHALLENGE 4: Grafana Dashboard Configuration
Problem: Panels showing "No Data" despite Prometheus metrics
Solution: Fixed data source URLs, updated query types
Impact: Real-time monitoring dashboards working

LESSONS LEARNED:
‚Ä¢ Start with infrastructure early
‚Ä¢ Test integration points thoroughly
‚Ä¢ Documentation prevents repeated issues
‚Ä¢ Monitor everything, not just the model
```

#### Presenter Notes:
**Challenge Introduction (15 seconds):**
"Every real project has challenges. Let me share the key technical issues we solved and what we learned."

**Docker Networking Challenge (45 seconds):**
"Our first major issue was Prometheus couldn't reach our API. This taught us about Docker networking - services running in containers can't access 'localhost' on the host machine. We had to use Docker's special hostname 'host.docker.internal'."

**CI/CD Pipeline Issues (45 seconds):**
"We had multiple pipeline failures due to code formatting tools conflicting with each other. The solution was creating a unified configuration file that made Black and isort work together. This is a common issue in Python projects."

**Synthetic Data Reality (30 seconds):**
"Our model performance is poor because synthetic data doesn't have realistic patterns. In a real project, you'd see much better results with actual customer data. But this allowed us to focus on building the MLOps infrastructure."

**Monitoring Configuration (30 seconds):**
"Getting Grafana dashboards working required understanding how Prometheus queries work and ensuring proper data source configuration."

**Key Takeaway:**
"These challenges taught us that MLOps is as much about infrastructure and integration as it is about machine learning."

**Transition:** "Despite these challenges, we achieved excellent results..."

#### Presenter Notes:
**Q&A Introduction (15 seconds):**
"Thank you for your attention. I'm excited to answer your questions about our MLOps implementation. We're prepared to dive deep into any technical aspects that interest you."

**Technical Questions - Prepared Answers:**

**"How would you improve model performance?"**
"First, we'd use real customer data instead of synthetic data. Second, we'd implement advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods. Third, we'd add model drift detection to retrain when performance degrades."

**"What would production deployment look like?"**
"We'd deploy to cloud platforms like AWS ECS or Kubernetes, implement auto-scaling, add authentication/authorization, set up proper logging and alerting, and implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates."

**"How do you handle model drift?"**
"We'd monitor prediction distributions, input feature statistics, and business metrics. When drift is detected, we'd automatically trigger model retraining workflows and A/B test new models before deployment."

**Business Questions - Prepared Answers:**

**"What's the ROI of this system?"**
"If this system helps retain even 1% more customers, the ROI is massive. For a telecom company with 1 million customers and $50/month ARPU, retaining 1% more customers is $6 million annual revenue."

**Architecture Questions - Prepared Answers:**

**"Why FastAPI over Flask/Django?"**
"FastAPI provides automatic API documentation, excellent performance, built-in data validation, and async support. It's specifically designed for modern API development."

**Live Demo Readiness:**
"I can demonstrate any part of our system live - from making API calls to showing monitoring dashboards to explaining our CI/CD pipeline."

**Closing Preparation:**
"Remember to thank the audience and provide contact information for follow-up questions."
